PMC is a super lightweight media center solution written in python.
It consists of two parts, a server and a player. The player can play pretty much
everything that mplayer can handle plus rar-files, the server analyses the data and contributes
with titles, ratings, posters and more.

========
 Player 
========
Should run on the machine that is connected to the monitor. The player will communicate
with the server to find out what movies and tv series that are available. The server IP and port
need to be set (!), see config.py.

Usage:
./main.py

Configuration:
See config.py

Permissions:
In order to be able to play rar-files, fuse and rarfs is needed. The user that runs the player must
have permission to mount the rar-files. Place the following line in /etc/sudoers (where username is the user):
username	ALL = NOPASSWD: /bin/fusermount, /sbin/mount.fuse, /usr/bin/fusermount

========
 Server
========
Should run on the machine that have (fast) access to all the movies and TV series, this could
be the same machine as the one that runs player. The server IP and port need to be set (!), see config.py.

The server should share directories with the player machine using for example nfs, sshfs, samba, netatalk etc. The
mapping of what directory is mounted where is configured by the player in config.py. The server can control what directories
to index by setting this in config.py as well.

Usage:
./main.py [--no-initsync] [--no-server] [--no-collector]

Configuration:
See config.py
