PMC is a lightweight mediacenter written in Python.
It plays pretty much everything that mplayer does, plus rar-files.
By analysing data found on the disk (or network) and presents information such as
correct titles, IMDB rating and posters.

Usage:
./pmc.py

Configuration:
See config.py

Modes:
PMC can run in three different modes; master, slave and server. The master mode (default mode) is
equal to run server+slave mode. Server mode means that it only analyses data on the disk, no GUI is launched.
Slave mode means that it only runs the player, all other information is fetched by connecting to a server. 

Permissions:
In order to be able to play rar-files, fuse and rarfs is needed. The user that runs the player must
have permission to mount the rar-files. Place the following line in /etc/sudoers (where username is the user):
username	ALL = NOPASSWD: /bin/fusermount, /sbin/mount.fuse, /usr/bin/fusermount
